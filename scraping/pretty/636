            "moreinformation": "The Purple Swamphen has striking purple plumage and a scarlet bill and head shield. Frequent flicking of its tail reveals a white undertail. Purple Swamphens love to pluck at reeds and rushes to feed on their white stem bases and roots. They also feed on small animals such as snails and frogs, but have been known to steal eggs and eat the young of other water fowl. Purple Swamphens are mainly found around swamps and marshes.",
