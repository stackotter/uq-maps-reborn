Water is used, recycled and treated internally within the building and any remaining treated water, which is nutrient rich water, is control released to the bio-retention basin for filtration. The bio-retention basin treats roof water and stormwater discharged as class \u201cA\u201d treated water from the building through the use of vegetation selected for its ability to slow runoff and provide effective filtration. The basin provides final filtration and water treatment prior to discharge to the UQ lake. The Global Change Institute building harvests and stores rainwater, has high efficiency water fixtures and fittings and also treats and reuses treated water for optimal water recycling.",
