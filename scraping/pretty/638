            "moreinformation": "The Brisbane River Turtle is a short-necked turtle native to the Brisbane River. It has an olive to brown carapace which can grow up to 28 centimetres and a yellow stripe on the sides of its face. The Brisbane River Turtle is an omnivorous turtle that feeds on small crustaceans, insects, algae and aquatic plants. The turtles often develop a mat of algae on their backs due to the high nutrient levels in the lakes. This does not harm them in any way - it actually helps with camouflage.",
