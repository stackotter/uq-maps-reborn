Flocks are often vast and noisy, consisting of up to several thousand birds. Little Corellas love to play and show off their acrobatic skills so don\u2019t be alarmed if you see them hanging upside down. The Little Corella develops a strong attachment to nest hollows \u2013 they use the same one year after year. They are thought to be an arid species adapting to available coastal resources. Despite being loud and conspicuous, during the nesting season it is very difficult to find them.", "web": "http://www.uq.edu.au/sustainability/little-corella", "link": "https://uqmaps.app.uq.edu.au/location/643", "buildingNum": null, "primaryType": "Sustainability", "otherTypes": []}, "typeCode": "sus"}]
