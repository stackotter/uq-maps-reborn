The IMB's mission is to decipher the information contained in the genes, proteins and molecules of humans, animals and plants. Since its establishment in 2000, the IMB has earned a reputation as one of the Asia Pacific region's leading research institutes. By understanding the development process and aspects that go awry in complex diseases, IMB aims to develop pharmaceutical and cellular therapies, technologies and diagnostics to prevent or treat such diseases. In addition, through studying both animals and plants, the IMB wishes to pursue other opportunities for applying our understanding of genetic programming and molecular architecture, which has the capacity to transform and create new industries in biology, information technology, green energy and agriculture.", "link": "https://uqmaps.app.uq.edu.au/location/150", "buildingNum": null, "primaryType": "Offices", "otherTypes": []}, "typeCode": "ofc"}]
