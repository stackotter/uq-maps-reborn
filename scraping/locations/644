It has two forward and two backward facing toes, making it easy to hold onto objects. Parrots have different shaped beaks depending on what they eat. Lorikeets focus on nectar and pollen so they have a short beak and their tongue does most of the work.", "web": "http://www.uq.edu.au/sustainability/rainbow-lorikeet", "link": "https://uqmaps.app.uq.edu.au/location/644", "buildingNum": null, "primaryType": "Sustainability", "otherTypes": []}, "typeCode": "sus"}]
