During the breeding season, the males react to potential mates by intensifying the colour of their tail fins so they become a bright red/orange fire colour to attract the females. Eggs are laid underneath leaves or rock ledges and are guarded by the male, who fans them with his fins until they hatch three to five days later.", "web": "http://www.uq.edu.au/sustainability/firetail-gudgeon", "link": "https://uqmaps.app.uq.edu.au/location/640", "buildingNum": null, "primaryType": "Sustainability", "otherTypes": []}, "typeCode": "sus"}]
